- Need full control over user credentials
- Targeting users who prefer email-based accounts

**Choose OAuth when:**
- Want quick signup with minimal friction
- Users already have social accounts
- Need access to social profile data

**Choose Passkeys when:**
- Want passwordless experience
- Targeting modern browsers/devices
- Security is top priority

**Choose Magic Link when:**
- Want passwordless without WebAuthn complexity
- Targeting email-first users
- Need temporary access links

**Combine Multiple Methods when:**
- Want flexibility for different user preferences
- Building enterprise apps with various auth requirements
- Need progressive enhancement (start simple, add more options)

## Core Architecture

Better Auth uses client-server architecture:
1. **Server** (`better-auth`): Handles auth logic, database ops, API routes
2. **Client** (`better-auth/client`): Provides hooks/methods for frontend
3. **Plugins**: Extend both server/client functionality
