# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

This Skill must be invoked in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

## Rule Categories by Priority

*For human/AI reference: follow priority 1→10 to decide which rule category to focus on first; use `--domain <Domain>` to query details when needed. Scripts do not read this table.*

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS &lt; 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |

| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

## Quick Reference

The table above is the index; the rules themselves — all ten categories, each
rule id with its one-line requirement — are in
`references/quick-reference-rules.md`, whose headings are the §1–§10 this skill
cites elsewhere. Load it to review an existing UI, fix a UI bug, or run the
pre-delivery sweep.

## Prerequisites

Check if Python is installed:

```bash
python3 --version || python --version
```

If Python is not installed, install it based on user's OS:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install python3
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

## How to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests any of the following:

| Scenario | Trigger Examples | Start From |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **New project / page** | "Build a landing page", "Build a dashboard" | Step 1 → Step 2 (design system) |
| **New component** | "Create a pricing card", "Add a modal" | Step 3 (domain search: style, ux) |
| **Choose style / color / font** | "What style fits a fintech app?", "Recommend a color palette" | Step 2 (design system) |
| **Review existing UI** | "Review this page for UX issues", "Check accessibility", "check my site against best practices" | Quick Reference checklist above, plus `references/web-interface-guidelines-review.md` for the external Web Interface Guidelines pass |
| **Fix a UI bug** | "Button hover is broken", "Layout shifts on load" | Quick Reference → relevant section |
| **Improve / optimize** | "Make this faster", "Improve mobile experience" | Step 3 (domain search: ux, react) |
| **Implement dark mode** | "Add dark mode support" | Step 3 (domain: style "dark mode") |
| **Add charts / data viz** | "Add an analytics dashboard chart" | Step 3 (domain: chart) |
| **Stack best practices** | "React performance tips"、"SwiftUI navigation" | Step 4 (stack search) |

Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: C-end consumer users; consider age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: resolve from the user request, package manifests and existing components

### Step 2: Generate a design system when the route calls for it

Use `--design-system` for new design decisions or when no existing system applies:

```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

**Example:**
```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

To save the design system for **hierarchical retrieval across sessions**, add `--persist`:

```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth with all design rules
- `design-system/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

**With page-specific override:**
```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --page "dashboard"
```

This also creates:
- `design-system/pages/dashboard.md` — Page-specific deviations from Master

**How hierarchical retrieval works:**
1. When building a specific page (e.g., "Checkout"), first check `design-system/pages/checkout.md`
2. If the page file exists, its rules **override** the Master file
3. If not, use `design-system/MASTER.md` exclusively

**Context-aware retrieval prompt:**
```
I am building the [Page Name] page. Please read design-system/MASTER.md.
Also check if design-system/pages/[page-name].md exists.
If the page file exists, prioritize its rules.
If not, use the Master rules exclusively.
Now, generate the code...
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

Use domain searches directly for targeted work; a design-system search is not a prerequisite:

```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**When to use detailed searches:**

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Product type patterns | `product` | `--domain product "entertainment social"` |
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "glassmorphism dark"` |
| Color palettes | `color` | `--domain color "entertainment vibrant"` |
| Font pairings | `typography` | `--domain typography "playful modern"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Alternative fonts | `typography` | `--domain typography "elegant luxury"` |
| Individual Google Fonts | `google-fonts` | `--domain google-fonts "sans serif popular variable"` |
| Landing structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |
| React Native perf | `react` | `--domain react "rerender memo list"` |
| App interface a11y | `web` | `--domain web "accessibilityLabel touch safe-areas"` |
| AI prompt / CSS keywords | `prompt` | `--domain prompt "minimalism"` |

### Step 4: Stack guidelines

Read script help for supported stacks and choose the project's stack. For example, a React Native project uses:

```bash
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack react-native
```

## Search Reference

### Available Domains

| Domain | Use For | Example Keywords |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `product` | Product type recommendations | SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, healthcare, beauty, service |
| `style` | UI styles, colors, effects | glassmorphism, minimalism, dark mode, brutalism |
| `typography` | Font pairings, Google Fonts | elegant, playful, professional, modern |
| `color` | Color palettes by product type | saas, ecommerce, healthcare, beauty, fintech, service |
| `landing` | Page structure, CTA strategies | hero, hero-centric, testimonial, pricing, social-proof |
| `chart` | Chart types, library recommendations | trend, comparison, timeline, funnel, pie |
| `ux` | Best practices, anti-patterns | animation, accessibility, z-index, loading |
| `google-fonts` | Individual Google Fonts lookup | sans serif, monospace, japanese, variable font, popular |
| `react` | React/Next.js performance | waterfall, bundle, suspense, memo, rerender, cache |
| `web` | App interface guidelines (iOS/Android/React Native) | accessibilityLabel, touch targets, safe areas, Dynamic Type |
| `prompt` | AI prompts, CSS keywords | (style name) |

### Available Stacks

| Stack | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Detected stack | Read `scripts/search.py --help` and matching data; retain existing framework |

## Example workflow

A worked end-to-end example — "Make an AI search homepage" through all four
steps — is in `references/example-workflow.md`.

## Output Formats

The `--design-system` flag supports two output formats:

```bash
# ASCII box (default) - best for terminal display
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system

# Markdown - best for documentation
python3 skills/ak-ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "fintech crypto" --design-system -f markdown
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Query Strategy

- Use **multi-dimensional keywords** — combine product + industry + tone + density: `"entertainment social vibrant content-dense"` not just `"app"`
- Try different keywords for the same need: `"playful neon"` → `"vibrant dark"` → `"content-first minimal"`
- Follow the scenario table: use `--design-system` for new systems, and `--domain` directly for targeted questions.
- Use `--stack` with the detected supported stack; do not force React Native onto web/Vue projects.

### Common Sticking Points

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run `--design-system` with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | Quick Reference §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | Quick Reference §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | Quick Reference §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | Quick Reference §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | Quick Reference §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | Quick Reference §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

## Common rules for professional UI

Load `references/professional-ui-rules.md` when implementing App UI
(iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter). It covers the frequently missed details that
make an interface read as unprofessional: icons and visual elements, App
interaction, light/dark contrast, and layout spacing.

## Pre-delivery checklist

Load `references/pre-delivery-checklist.md` before delivering. It carries the UX
validation pass, the §1–§3 review sweep, and the visual, interaction, dark-mode,
layout and accessibility checks.
